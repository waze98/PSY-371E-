### **Python Homework Assignment: Variables, Types, and Operators**

**Objective:** Understand the basic concepts of variables, their types, and how operators can be used to manipulate them.

#### Start a new JupyterLab Notebook and add code cells as needed. You can also add markdown cells to keep track of the questions.

---

**1. Variables and Assignment**

a) Declare a variable `name` and assign your name to it. Print the variable.

b) Declare a variable `age` and assign your age to it. Print the variable.

c) Swap the values of `name` and `age` without using a temporary variable. Print the new values of `name` and `age`.

---

**2. Data Types**

a) Using the `type()` function, determine and print the data type of the following values. Three of these will be new to you, but we'll cover them soon!

- 5
- 5.0
- "5"
- [5]
- (5, )
- {5}
- True

b) Declare a variable `is_student` and assign it the value `True` if you're a student, otherwise `False`. Print the variable.

---

**3. Basic Operators**

a) Using the `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operators, perform the following operations:

- Add 15 and 23
- Subtract 50 from 34
- Multiply 8 by 7
- Divide 100 by 4

Print all results.

b) Declare two variables `a = 10` and `b = 5`. Calculate and print the following:

- The remainder when `a` is divided by `b`
- The result of `a` raised to the power of `b`

---

**4. Type Conversion**

a) Convert the string `"123"` to an integer and print the result.

b) Convert the integer `456` to a string and print the result.

c) Convert the float `78.9` to an integer. What value do you get?

---

**5. String Manipulation with Operators**

a) Concatenate (join) the following strings and print the result: `"Python"` and `"Rocks"`.

b) Repeat the string `"Hello "` three times using the multiplication operator. Print the result.

---

**6. Bonus Question**

Declare three variables: `x = 5`, `y = 10`, and `z = 15`. Using only the arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and the variable names, swap the values of the variables such that `x` has the value of `y`, `y` has the value of `z`, and `z` has the value of `x`. 

(So, for example, x = x + z would be fair, but x = 20 would be cheating!)

Good luck!
